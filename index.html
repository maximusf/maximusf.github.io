      <h2>Problem statement: Mentor App for Students</h2>
            <p>
                Students and young adults have a hard time finding mentors and getting advice from people in the industry they want to get in. 
                <br>Getting connections and networking is hard for many students. Which makes it hard for them to find interships and research opportunities.

    <p>
    My group discussed different features and nuances that we may run into while creating a mentor app for students. 
    <br>These ideas ranged from marketing, price of entry, front-end of the app, and the filtering process used to help students.
