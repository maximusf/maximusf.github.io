      <h2>Problem statement: Mentor App for Students</h2>
            <p>
                Students and young adults have a hard time finding mentors and getting advice from people in the industry they want to get in. Getting connections and networking is hard for many students. Which makes it hard for them to find interships and research opportunities.
