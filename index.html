      <h2>Problem statement: Mentor App for Students</h2>
            <p>
                Students and young adults have a hard time finding mentors and getting advice from people in the industry they want to get in. 
                Getting connections and networking is hard for many students. Which makes it hard for them to find interships and research opportunities.

    <p>
    My group discussed different features and nuances that we may run into while creating a mentor app for students. 
    <br>These ideas ranged from marketing, price of entry, front-end of the app, and the filtering process used to help students.
